        SimScript
    </h1>
    <p>
        A Discrete Event Simulation library in TypeScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>SimScript</b> uses JavaScript's
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await">async/await</a>
        features in JavaScript to make simulation scripts easy to write and understand.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>SimScript</b> simulations are built using these classes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Simulation</b>:
            Creates entities and resources (queues) and schedules the execution of the entity
            scripts as they execute their tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Queues</b>:
            Represent resources that can be seized and released by entities. Queues keep track
            of their utilization and may constrain the flow of entities through the simulation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Entities</b>:
            Represent active elements that execute scripts. Scripts are JavaScript methods that
            contain instructions for entities. Typical actions are entering and leaving queues,
            going through delays, or sending signals.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Animation</b>:
            Uses HTML to render entities waiting in queues or in transit between queues.
            Animations are useful for presentations and also for debugging simulations.
        </li>
    </ul>
